The SIR-adjusted WLB can be a competitive alternative to other integration methds in certain models. We note that, given a sample simulated from the posterior distribution, the required marginal likelihood may be simulation consistently estimated by the harmonic mean of the associated likelihood values; a modification of the estimator that avoids instability is also noted. These methods provide simple ways of calculating approximate Bayes factors and posterior model probabilities for a very wide class of models. 22.2 Introduction This paper investigates the extent to which a new bootstrap procedure â€“ the weighted likelihood bootstrap (WLB) - can be used by applied Bayesian statisticians to approximate posterior distributions. This is direct extension of the Bayesian bootstrap. The WLB used in isolation is not simulation consisent: it does not produce exact answers as the amount of computing resources increases without bound. The paper is organized as: - Section 2 description of the method for independent data and application to a non-linear regression problem. - 3 Exact properties of the WLB. - 4 Asymptotic properties - 5 Implement of the WLB - 6 Extension to dependent data models and to partial likelihood. - 7 We study a method for approximating marginal likelihoods by using samples from a posterior distribution. From this index, what we need is section 7. So the reading plan is 2,5 and 7, maybe 3. 22.3 The Method Consider modelling data \\(x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\) as independent, each \\(x_i\\) having probability density function \\(f_i(x_i;\\theta)\\), the likelihood function for the parameter \\(\\theta\\), \\[ L(\\theta)=\\prod_{i=1}^{n} f_{i}\\left(x_{i} ; \\theta\\right) \\] Started with a prior \\(\\pi(\\theta)\\). Posterior density proportional to \\(L(\\theta)\\pi(\\theta)\\). In the WLB method, a sample is produced by maximizing a weighted likelihood function \\[ \\tilde{L}(\\theta):=\\prod_{i=1}^{n} f_{i}\\left(x_{i} ; \\theta\\right)^{w_{n, t}} \\] where the weight vector \\(w_{n}=\\left(w_{n, 1}, \\dots, w_{n, n}\\right)\\) has some probability distribution determined by the statistician. The function \\(\\tilde L\\) is not a likelihood in the usual sense; it is merely a device for generating a sample on the parameter space. Denote \\(\\tilde \\theta\\) as any parameter value satisfying \\(\\tilde{L}(\\tilde{\\theta}) \\geqslant \\tilde{L}(\\theta)\\) for all \\(\\theta\\) in the parameter space. The likelihood \\(L\\) are fixed after the data are observed, the weighed likelihood \\(\\tilde{L}\\) and its maximizer \\(\\tilde \\theta\\) have randomness induced by the distribution of the weights. The thesis of this paper, showed that for certain weight distributions, the conditional distribution of \\(\\tilde \\theta\\) given the data can provide a good approximation to a posterior distribution of \\(\\theta\\). Although this conditional distribution is usually difficult to find exactly, it is straightforward to simulate when maximization of \\(\\tilde{L}\\) is feasible. Motivated by inference for multinomial data, a natural weight distribution is the uniform Dirichlet distribution. The weight distribution in \\(\\tilde{L}\\) Such weights are simulated by generating \\(n\\) independent exponentials \\(Y_i\\) and forming \\(w_{n, i}=Y_{i} / \\bar{Y}\\), where \\(\\bar{Y}\\) is the sample mean of the \\(Y_i\\). When combining the WLB with importance sampling, it is computationally convenient to form weights \\(w_{n, i} \\propto Y_{i}^{\\alpha}\\) for some power \\(\\alpha\\neq 1\\). If \\(\\alpha &gt;1\\), the weight distribution is overdispersed relative to the Dirichlet distribution. Many weight distributions could be postulated. Example: A non-linear regression model, relates biochemical oxygen demand \\(x\\) of prepared water samples to incubation time \\(t\\) by the equation: \\[ x_{i}=\\beta_{1}\\left\\{1-\\exp \\left(-\\beta_{2} t_{i}\\right)\\right\\}+\\epsilon_{i} \\quad i=1,2, \\ldots, n \\] Thee error \\(\\epsilon_i\\) are assumed to be independent normal errors with constant variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), assigned an improper prior \\(\\pi\\left(\\sigma^{2}\\right) \\propto \\sigma^{-2}\\). The generic parameter \\(\\theta\\) incorporates both the regression parameter vector \\(\\beta\\) and the scale parameter \\(\\sigma\\). A transformation invariant, design-dependent prior for \\(\\beta=\\left(\\beta_{1}, \\beta_{2}\\right)\\) is \\(\\pi(\\beta) \\propto\\left|V^{\\mathrm{T}} V\\right|^{1 / 2}\\) where \\(V\\) is the \\(n\\times 2\\) matrix having \\((i,j)\\)th element \\(\\partial E_{\\beta}\\left(x_{i}\\right) / \\partial \\beta_{j}\\). We can quite directly obtain maximum likelihood estimates for this model by using routines for non-linear optimization. Bayesian inference is not simple here because marginal posteriors pose difficult integration problems. The WLB takes advantage of the available estimation technology to carry out the integration. Section 5 described maximizing \\(\\tilde L\\) for any particular set of weights is done by simply including a weight vector in the estimation routine. The WLB samples do not come from the joint posterior exactly, because, for one thing, no prior information was used in the simulation. However, a simple adjustment based on importance sampling can correct this. The basic idea is that \\(g\\), the joint density of \\(\\tilde \\beta\\), is a good approximation to the marginal posterior density of \\(\\beta\\) and hence is a good choice for an importance sampling density. To finish the analysis, each \\(\\tilde \\beta^j\\) in the raw WLB sample must be assigned an importance weight \\[ u_{j} \\propto r\\left(\\tilde{\\beta}^{j}\\right)=\\pi\\left(\\tilde{\\beta}^{j}\\right) L_{m}\\left(\\tilde{\\beta}_{j}\\right) / \\hat{g}\\left(\\tilde{\\beta}_{j}\\right) \\] 22.4 5 Implementation and Examples 22.4.1 Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares Consider a weighted likelihood function \\(\\tilde L\\) which is maximized by solving the (vector) weighted likelihood equation \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{l}}{\\partial \\theta}(\\theta)=0 \\] for \\(\\tilde \\theta\\in R^k\\). There is a close connection between a solution \\(\\tilde \\theta\\) of equation and the IRLS solution \\(\\hat\\theta\\) of the likelihood equation \\[ \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial \\theta}(\\theta)=0 \\] where \\(l\\) is the logarithm of the likelihood function. \\(\\tilde l\\) is viewed as a function of an n-vector of predictors \\(\\eta=\\left(\\eta_{1}, \\eta_{2}, \\dots, \\eta_{n}\\right)^{\\mathrm{T}}\\). These predictors, in turn, are viewed as functions of the parameter \\(\\theta\\); thus \\(\\eta=\\eta(\\theta)\\). Letting u be the n-vector \\((\\partial l / \\partial \\eta)\\) and D the \\(n\\times k\\) matrix \\((\\partial \\eta / \\partial \\theta)\\), the weighted likelihood equation becomes simply \\[ D^{\\mathrm{T}} W u=0 \\] where \\(W\\) is an \\(n\\times n\\) diagonal matrix with weights \\(w_{n,i}\\) on its diagonal. The model densities are assumed to have the form \\(f_{i}\\left(x_{i} ; \\theta\\right)=\\psi_{i}\\left(\\eta_{i}, x_{i}\\right)\\) where, for each \\(i\\),\\(\\psi_i\\) is fixed, known, function determined by the model. Other example ommit here. 22.5 Using Samples From Posterior To Evaluate The Marginal Likelihood Bayes factor : \\[ B_{01}=\\frac{p\\left(x | M_{0}\\right)}{p\\left(x | M_{1}\\right)} \\] in this equation: \\[ p\\left(x | M_{j}\\right)=\\int p\\left(x | \\theta_{j}, M_{j}\\right) p\\left(\\theta_{j} | M_{j}\\right) \\mathrm{d} \\theta_{j} \\] \\(\\theta_j\\) is the parameter of model \\(M_j\\) and \\(p(\\theta_j|M_j)\\) is the prior density of \\(\\theta_j\\) under model \\(M_j,(j=0,1)\\). We call \\(p(x|M_j)\\) the marginal likelihood of the data under \\(M_j\\). The Bayesian inference, prediction and decision-making all involve their posterior probabilities: \\[ p\\left(M_{j} | x\\right)=p\\left(x | M_{j}\\right) p\\left(M_{j}\\right) / \\sum_{k=0}^{J} p\\left(x | M_{k}\\right) p\\left(M_{k}\\right) \\] where \\(p(M_j)\\) is the prior probability of the model \\(M_j\\). Again, the marginal likelihoods \\(p(x|M_j)\\) are the crucial components. If we dropping the notation dependence on \\(M_j\\), then the marginal likelihood becomes \\[ p(x)=\\int p(x | \\theta) p(\\theta) \\mathrm{d} \\theta \\] Importance Sampling Basic importance sampling \\[ \\mu=\\mathbb{E}(f(\\boldsymbol{X}))=\\int_{\\mathcal{D}} f(\\boldsymbol{x}) p(\\boldsymbol{x}) \\mathrm{d} \\boldsymbol{x} \\] with another proposal \\(q\\): \\[ \\mu=\\int_{\\mathcal{D}} f(\\boldsymbol{x}) p(\\boldsymbol{x}) \\mathrm{d} \\boldsymbol{x}=\\int_{\\mathcal{D}} \\frac{f(\\boldsymbol{x}) p(\\boldsymbol{x})}{q(\\boldsymbol{x})} q(\\boldsymbol{x}) \\mathrm{d} \\boldsymbol{x}=\\mathbb{E}_{q}\\left(\\frac{f^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X}) p(\\boldsymbol{X})}{q(\\boldsymbol{X})}\\right) \\] Then the importance sampling estimate of \\(\\mu=\\mathbb{E}_{p}(f(\\boldsymbol{X}))\\) is \\[ \\hat{\\mu}_{q}=\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{f\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i}\\right) p\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i}\\right)}{q\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i}\\right)}, \\quad \\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\sim q \\] The Monte Carlo method for evaluating integrals of the form \\(I=\\int g(\\theta) p(\\theta) \\mathrm{d} \\theta\\) is to generate a sample \\(\\left\\{\\theta^{(i)}: i=1, \\dots, m\\right\\}\\) from a density \\(p^*(\\theta)\\). Under quite general conditions, a simulation consistent estimate of \\(I\\) is \\[ \\hat{I}=\\sum_{i=1}^{m} w_{i} g\\left(\\theta^{(i)}\\right) / \\sum_{i=1}^{m} w_{i} \\] where \\(w_{i}=p\\left(\\theta^{(i)}\\right) / p^{*}\\left(\\theta^{(i)}\\right)\\); the function \\(p^*(\\theta)\\) is known as the importance sampling function. This is different form from standard important sampling, from this book, Chapter 9 importance sampling, this form is the Self-normalized importance sampling, which can use unnormalized version of p and q. The WLB gives us a sample approximately drawn from the posterior density \\[ p ^*(\\theta)=p(\\theta | x)=p(x | \\theta) p(\\theta) / p(x) \\] In general, most functions \\(g(\\theta)\\) could be a poor importance sampling function, but here we have \\(g(\\theta)=p(x|\\theta)\\), and the importance sampling function \\(p^{*}(\\theta)=p(\\theta | x)\\) is well suited for this case. Then a estimate for \\(p(x)\\), \\[ \\hat{p}_{1}(x)=\\left\\{\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} p\\left(x | \\theta^{(i)}\\right)^{-1}\\right\\}^{-1} \\] the harmonic mean of the likelihood values. This is true whether the posterior samples come from an SIR-adjusted WLB or any other sampling scheme, like the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. It is readily verified that \\(\\hat p_1(x)\\) converges almost surely to the correct value \\(p(x)\\) as \\(m\\rightarrow \\infty\\). However, \\(\\hat p_1(x)\\) does not, in general, satisfy a Gaussian central limit theorem. This manifests itself by the occasional occurence of a value of \\(\\theta^{(i)}\\) with a small likelihood and hence a large effect on the final result; it happens because \\(p(x | \\theta)^{-1}\\) is often not square integrable with respect to the posterior distribution. Square integrable: \\[ f: \\mathbb{R} \\mapsto \\mathbb{C} \\text { square integrable } \\Longleftrightarrow \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}|f(x)|^{2} \\mathrm{d} x&lt;\\infty \\] An alternative is \\[ \\hat{p}_{2}(x)=\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} p\\left(x | \\theta^{(i)}\\right) \\] where \\(\\left\\{\\theta^{(i)}: i=1, \\ldots, m\\right\\}\\) is a sample from the prior distribution rather than the posterior. A major difficulty with \\(\\hat{p}_{2}(x)\\) is that most of the \\(\\theta^{(i)}\\) will have small likelihood values if the posterior is concentrated relative to the prior, so that the simulation process will be quite inefficient. Thus the estimate will be dominated by a few large values of the likelihood, and so the variance of \\(\\hat{p}_{2}(x)\\) may be large and its convergence to a Gaussian distribution slow. These difficulties are precisely the opposite of the difficulties with \\(\\hat p_1(x)\\). These considerations suggest that we use as importance sampling function a mixture of the prior and posterior densities, with \\[ p^{*}(\\theta)=\\delta p(\\theta)+(1-\\delta) p(\\theta | x) \\] where \\(\\delta\\) is small. This yields a new estimate \\(\\hat{p}_{3}(x)\\), defined by the equation \\[ \\hat{p}_{3}(x)=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{m} p\\left(x | \\theta^{(i)}\\right) /\\left\\{\\delta \\hat{p}_{3}(x)+(1-\\delta) p\\left(x | \\theta^{(i)}\\right)\\right\\}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\left\\{\\hat{p}_{3}(x)+(1-\\delta) p\\left(x | \\theta^{(i)}\\right)\\right\\}^{-1}} \\] The estimator \\(\\hat p_3(x)\\) is appealing because it retains the efficiency of \\(\\hat p_1(x)\\), due to being based mostly on high likelihood values of \\(\\theta\\), but avoids its unpleasant instability. It is readily verified that \\(\\hat p_3(x)\\) does not satisfy a Gaussian central limit theorem, unlike \\(\\hat p_1(x)\\). However, \\(\\hat p_3(x)\\) has the irksome aspect that we must simulate from the prior as well as the posterior. Simulation from the prior as well as the posterior may be avoided, without sacrificing the appealing aspects of \\(\\hat p_3(x)\\), by instead simulating all \\(m\\) values from the posterior distribution and imagining that a further \\(\\delta_{m} /(1-\\delta)\\) values of \\(\\theta\\) are drawn from the prior, all with likelihood \\(p\\left(x | \\theta^{(i)}\\right)\\) equal to their expected value \\(p(x)\\). This yields an approximation to \\(\\hat p_3(x)\\), namely \\[ \\hat{p}_{4}(x)=\\frac{\\delta m /(1-\\delta)+\\sum_{i=1}^{m} p\\left(x | \\theta^{(i)}\\right) /\\left\\{\\delta \\hat{p}_{4}(x)+(1-\\delta) p\\left(x | \\theta^{(i)}\\right)\\right\\}}{\\delta m /(1-\\delta) \\hat{p}_{4}(x)+\\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\left\\{\\delta \\hat{p}_{4}(x)+(1-\\delta) p\\left(x | \\theta^{(i)}\\right)\\right\\}^{-1}} \\] The estimator \\(\\hat p_4(x)\\) may be evaluated by using a simple and obvious iterative scheme; in our limited experience to date, this converges fast, often in a single step. \\(\\hat p_4(x)\\) performed well for \\(\\delta\\) as small as 0.01 and did not display any of the instability of \\(\\hat p_1(x)\\).
